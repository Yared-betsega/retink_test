Each folder has it's own functionality. Let's look at the folders separately

# src/: 
This is the main source code directory of our application.

- controllers/: Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. They typically contain functions that define the behavior of our API endpoints. Example:

  author.controller.ts: Contains functions like createAuthor, getAuthorById, etc., which handle author-related API requests.

  blog.controller.ts: Contains functions like createBlog, getBlogById, etc., which handle blog-related API requests.

  comment.controller.ts: Contains functions like createComment, getCommentById, etc., which handle comment-related API requests.

- models/: Models define the structure of our data. They often correspond to database tables or collections. Example:

  author.model.ts: Defines the schema for an author, including fields like fullName and email.

  blog.model.ts: Defines the schema for a blog, including fields like title, content, and references to authors.

  comment.model.ts: Defines the schema for a comment, including fields like text and references to blogs and users.

- routes/: Routes define the API endpoints and how they are mapped to controller functions. Example:

  author.routes.ts: Defines routes like /api/authors for author-related endpoints and maps them to corresponding controller functions.

  blog.routes.ts: Defines routes like /api/blogs for blog-related endpoints and maps them to corresponding controller functions.

  comment.routes.ts: Defines routes like /api/comments for comment-related endpoints and maps them to corresponding controller functions.

- services/: Services contain the business logic of our application. They interact with controllers, repositories, and models to perform various tasks  
    Example:

  author.service.ts: Contains functions like createAuthor and getAuthorById, which implement business logic for author-related operations.

  blog.service.ts: Contains functions like createBlog and getBlogById, which implement business logic for blog-related operations.

  comment.service.ts: Contains functions like createComment and getCommentById, which implement business logic for comment-related operations.

- repositories/: Repositories handle database interactions. They abstract the database access code from the services. Example:

  author.repository.ts: Contains methods like createAuthor and getAuthorById, which interact with the database (e.g., MongoDB) to perform author-related operations.

  blog.repository.ts: Contains methods like createBlog and getBlogById, which interact with the database to perform blog-related operations.

  comment.repository.ts: Contains methods like createComment and getCommentById, which interact with the database to perform comment-related operations.

- utils/: Utilities contain helper functions or modules used throughout our application. Example:

  error-handler.ts: Contains functions for handling errors and generating consistent error responses in our application.

  validation.ts: Contains functions or schemas for data validation, which can be used to validate incoming data.

- app.ts: This is the entry point for our Express application. It sets up middleware, routes, and starts the server.

- server.ts: This file is responsible for starting the server and listening on a specific port.

- .env: This file contains environment variables that configure our application.

- package.json: This file contains project metadata and dependencies. It defines scripts for running our application, installing dependencies, and more.

- tsconfig.json: This file is the TypeScript configuration file that specifies how TypeScript should compile our code.
